rpg-core
========

The core classes for a simple roguelike.

To try it out, build with Maven:

    mvn clean install

This builds the project, runs the tests, and installs everything in
your local Maven repository (`~/.m2/repository`).

You can then use the `run-core.py` wrapper script to start an ASCII
interface which lets you move around and (sort of) interact with some
sample creatures:

    ./run-core.py
